The code allows converting parametric equations from https://www.wolframalpha.com/
1. Find a person curve on the site
2. Click on 'plain text' below a snippet with equations and copy the text
3. Create an empty file 'Text.txt' on your local computer in a Python project folder where  and paste the text. Close the file
4. Run the script on your computer
5. Open the 'Text.txt' file and copy the text
6. Open a new project in Tableau, create a calculation X and paste the text. There will be 2 strings pasted. 
7. Cut a lower string ad click 'Ok'
8. Create a new calculation 'Y' and paste it, click 'Ok'

Now we have parametric equation for X and Y where t is a variable
